# Rmap and prediction
Visualisation and prediction of terror attack types using R, ggmap, ggplot, dplyr and caret and more.
The goal was to predict attack type on basis of multiple variables. 

The work mostly consisted of extensively cleaning the data and explorative research. Naive Bayes was used for the predictions, and were presented on a map via ggmap and ggplot.
